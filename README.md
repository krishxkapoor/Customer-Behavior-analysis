This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow — from data loading and cleaning to analysis, SQL querying, and dashboard visualization.
It was developed using Python (Pandas), PostgreSQL, and Power BI to derive actionable insights from raw data.

🎯 Objectives

Load and explore a dataset using Python.

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data trends and patterns.

Clean and preprocess data for analysis.

Run PostgreSQL queries for deeper insights.

Build an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize results.

📊 Workflow

Data Loading: Imported dataset using Pandas for analysis.

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats.

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):

Analyzed key metrics and correlations.

Visualized trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

PostgreSQL Queries:

Created and ran SQL queries to extract insights.

Connected PostgreSQL with Python using psycopg2 / SQLAlchemy.

Power BI Dashboard:

Built interactive charts and KPIs.

Highlighted important business insights and recommendations.
